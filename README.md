# Online_Course_Registration

This is an online course registration system which can be implemented in universities 
where students can easily enrol themselves into courses and admins can manage the 
courses, departments, and students
The admin user is in charge of handling all of the system's information; specifically, 
he or she will register new students, create courses and departments, and keep track of the 
total number of enrolees. The student can log in to the system using his or her Registration 
Number and the password the admin issued after creating the student access. The student 
has the option to enrol in a course for a particular level. Additionally, he or she can modify 
their profile and system password. Then the student can also print his/her enrolment 
records same as the admin for all students.
Also, a user log table is created which keeps records of every time a student logs into 
and logs out of the portal to register for a course. For every table there are “creation Date”
and “update date” columns which automatically get updated keeping track of when 
something was created.
Apart from all the relevant queries being executed, admins can execute their own 
queries in the query runner page for which they have exclusive access to. Relevant graphs 
have also been shown.
###Scope:

####c. For online course completion sites where level of course to which one enrols has a
greater importance to be managed (Coursea etc)
